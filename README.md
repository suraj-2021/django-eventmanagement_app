# django-eventmanagement_app
I'm creating a event management app in Django, where users can view the events in any selected date and create new desired events for themselves.
I will be adding calender and give users control to select add venues, event date time etc.
Also added Delete option to delete data from database.
Ordered Database items from their name.
Added PDF,TXT and CSV download option.
Pagination will also be added soon, While making the interface more user friendly.
